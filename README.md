Project analysing video games sales and scores

The purpose of this project is retrieve data from Kaggle (Video Game Sales with Ratings Video game sales from Vgchartz and corresponding ratings from Metacritic by Rush Kirubi https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), which was gathered from VGCHARTZ (http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/) and MetaCritic (https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available) using BeautifulSoup.

My target audience is a stakeholder interested in creating a video game. This analysis is being conducted in order to help them understand the video game industry (platforms, genres, etc). 

From the data we can have on overview of multiple questions, like in which year which video game Publisher was the most succesful, or which games were the most popular, which region (USA, EU, JAPAN, OTHER countries) had most of the games sold in millions of units.

The three questions being analysed:

Question 1: In Japan does Nintendo sell better than Xbox?

Question 2: Are shooter Games in USA sell better than sport games?

Question 3: Do Users and Critics give equal scores?


My hypotheses are:

1. Nintendo sells better in Japan, than Xbox.
The Null Hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in number of sales of the games for this two platforms.

2. Sports games better than Shooter games.
The Null Hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in number of sales of Sports and Shooter games.

3. Critics and Users has different taste, meaning they will give different scores for games.
The Null Hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the scores of Critics and Users.


My alpha values are set at 0.05.

Answers:

Question 1: In Japan Nintendo sells better than Xbox

Question 2: In Average Shooter Games in USA sell better than sport games, but is total sum of units sold Sports games sell better

Question 3: Users and Critics give different scores

--------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------

Further "to-do"s:
For a better business understanding not only the number of units sold, but the unit price and/or a total amount of revenue would be very useful. 
A better understanding of PC games industry also would be essential.
